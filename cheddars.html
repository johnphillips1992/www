<h1 class="cover-heading">The Flatulating Waitress</h1>
<p class="lead">There's no doubt the waitress at Cheddars 
tonight knew how to cut the cheese. She walks by and 
a I just got fart right in the face. Accidental fart in 
the face is fine, but this was intentional. I'm not 
saying this was the worst waitress ever, I'm saying 
I left Cheddars with a general hatred towards her. 
When she messes up the order and forgets to bring the salad.
When you wait thirty minutes after you finish eating 
and then have to ask for the check. When she doesn't 
leave a pen to sign the receipt because she is too 
busy counting the accidental tip your friend left 
when he got tired of waiting. When she walks by 
and farts right in your face. You get the feeling 
the hatred is mutual.</p>
